# Things that can be improved

1. Make the project more modular. Essentially, we can make remove some of the existing componenets and make a single reusable component which can take props and some styling to fit the needs of each initialisation. For example, the IntroSection component, the ReviewSlide component and the ContactUs component are all having a very similar page strcuture that is image on half of the page and some text/buttons on the other half of the page. Similarly, the CustomerReviews component anf the GetStarted component both share the same structure and with minimal styling can be modularised

2. Develop some styled components with the theme color which is dark blue.

3. IMPLEMENT NIGHT MODE, this is so important, I was coding at night usually, after work hours and the lack of night mode in the original page was just hurting my eyes.

4. Resposiveness has room for improvements by adding some more Bootstrap classes to optoimise the breakpoints for example in the Row tag adding xs=1 or xs=2 to optimise fit.
